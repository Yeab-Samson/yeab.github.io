# 📅 Week 2

This is Week 2 of my rising senior year. I started learning the C programming language last week and am getting closer to buying my first Arduino kit. I'm beginning to feel more confident in my coding journey and staying deeply focused on my future goals.

My school is organizing a summer internship opportunity for students like me to help build confidence and encourage collaboration. I believe this summer is going to be different — I can already feel it.

For this week, my goals are:
- Complete learning the basics of C
- Purchase the Arduino kit
- Join a volunteering community
- Pinpoint my dream universities

# 🗓️ Week 3–8 Update

Although I didn’t document my progress weekly, I’ve been active behind the scenes! Over the past few weeks, I’ve focused on strengthening my programming skills through consistent practice and small experiments — especially with JavaScript, Arduino, and web development tools.

I am also participating in the **Zemenay Tech Solutions Hackathon**, where I work on building a modular blog system. The goal is to create a blog solution that integrates easily with any Next.js frontend, using Supabase and PostgreSQL on the backend. It is a great chance to apply my learning and collaborate on real-world code.

In Week 8, I also started recording devlog-style videos to reflect on my progress and stay accountable — a small step toward better documentation and sharing.
