This is week 2 of my rising senior level. I have started to learn c programming language last week, and 
I am getting closer to buy an arduino kit. I am starting to get more confident in coding and have been deeply focused on my future.
My school is organising a summer internship opportuity for students like me to help boost my confidence and cooperate with other students.
This summer is going to be different, i just feel it.
For this week, i am aiming to complete learning c program so i could buy the arduino kit, join a volunteering community
and pinpoint my dream schools.
