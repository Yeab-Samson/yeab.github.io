#week 2
This is week 2 of my rising senior level. I have started to learn c programming language last week, and 
I am getting closer to buy an arduino kit. I am starting to get more confident in coding and have been deeply focused on my future.
My school is organising a summer internship opportuity for students like me to help boost my confidence and cooperate with other students.
This summer is going to be different, i just feel it.
For this week, i am aiming to complete learning c program so i could buy the arduino kit, join a volunteering community
and pinpoint my dream schools.

#🗓️ Week 3–8 Update
Although I didn’t document everything weekly, I’ve been active behind the scenes! During these past weeks, I focused on deepening my programming skills through consistent practice and small experiments — particularly with JavaScript, Arduino, and web dev tools.

I also got involved in a hackathon project organized by Zemenay Tech Solutions, where the challenge was to build a modular blog system that integrates with any Next.js frontend and uses Supabase + PostgreSQL for the backend. It’s been a great way to apply what I’ve learned and collaborate on real-world code.

This week (Week 8), I also started recording some devlog-style videos to reflect on progress and share updates — pushing myself to stay accountable and document more consistently.
